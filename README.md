# PyTorch Project to Build a GAN Model on MNIST Dataset

# Project Description

# Overview

The GANs are mainly used in image-to-image translation and to generate photorealistic images which even a human fails to identify as fake or true.

In this project, we start by introducing Generative Adversarial Networks. The PyTorch framework is used to build the GAN model on the MNIST dataset. Finally, we learn how to use the Generator model for generating new images of digits.  

# Goal

# Approach

- Introduction to Generative Adversarial Network
